<title>DITA to Word output transform</title>

<conbody>
<p>The whole structure of the output file is the same as the structure
designed in the ditamap file of the DITA source files. To avoid losing
files in the final output, make sure the ditamap file contains all
topics which are cross referenced from within any individual topics.</p>

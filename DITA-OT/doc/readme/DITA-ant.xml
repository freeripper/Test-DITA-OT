<shortdesc>Ant is an open tool that the DITA Open Toolkit uses to
manage builds.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<section><title>Introduction to Ant</title><p>Ant is a Java-based,
open source tool provided by the Apache Foundation to declare a sequence
of build actions. It is well suited for development builds as well
as document builds. The "Full Easy Install" version of the toolkit
ships with a copy of Ant.</p><?Pub Caret -1?><p>DITA provides a set
of XSLT scripts for producing different types of        documentation,
such as help output in Eclipse, Java Help and HTML Help, XHTML pages,
and PDF. The DITA-OT uses Ant to manage these scripts, as well as
to manage additional intermediate steps written in Java. </p></section>

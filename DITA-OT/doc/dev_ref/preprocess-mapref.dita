<title>Resolve map references (mapref)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>mapref</codeph> module resolves references
from one map to another.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>Maps may reference other maps using markup similar to
the following:<codeblock>&lt;topicref href="other.ditamap" format="ditamap"/></codeblock></p><p>The
DITA 1.2 standard added a new element that allows this sort of reference
without setting the format attribute:<codeblock>&lt;mapref href="other.ditamap"/></codeblock></p><p>In
either case, the element that references the other map is replaced
by the topic references from the other map. Relationship tables are
pulled into the referencing map as a child of the root element (&lt;map>
or a specialization of &lt;map>).</p><p>This step is implemented in
XSLT.</p></section>

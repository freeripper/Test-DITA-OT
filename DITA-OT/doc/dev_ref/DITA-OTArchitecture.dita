<title>DITA Open Toolkit Architecture</title>
<shortdesc>The DITA Open Toolkit is an open source implementation
of the OASIS DITA Technical Committee's specification for Darwin Information
Typing Architecture (DITA) DTDs and schemas. The toolkit uses open
source solution of ANT, XSLT (currently 1.0 for most processing, with
XSLT 2.0 for PDF) and Java to implement transformation functions from
DITA content (maps and topics) into different deliverable formats.</shortdesc>

<section><title>Processing structure</title><p>The DITA Open Toolkit
implements a multi-stage, map-driven architecture to process DITA
content. Each step in the process examines some or all of the content;
some steps result in temporary files used by later steps, while others
result in updated copies of the DITA content. Most of the processing
takes place in a temporary working directory (the source files themselves
are never modified).</p><p>Transformations in the toolkit are designed
like a pipeline. Most of the pipeline is common between all output
formats, and is known as the "pre-process" stage. In general, any
DITA process begins with this common set of pre-processing routines.
Once the pre-processing is completed, the pipeline diverges based
on the desired output format. Some processing is still common to multiple
output formats; for example, Eclipse Help and HTML Help both use the
same routines to generate XHTML topics, after which the two pipelines
branch to create a different set of navigation files.</p><p>The
following image illustrates how the pipeline works for some common
output types.</p><image href="images/mainarch.gif" placement="break">

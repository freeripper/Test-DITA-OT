<title>TocJS output path</title>
<shortdesc>The TocJS transform type was originally created as a plug-in
distributed outside of the toolkit, but now ships bundled in the default
packages. This XHTML based output type creates a JavaScript based
frameset with TOC entries that expand and collapse.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>A few Ant targets control most of the TocJS processing:<ul>
<li><codeph>tocjsInit</codeph> is used to set up default properties.
This template detects whether builds have already set a name for the
JavaScript control file; if not, the default name <filepath>toctree.js</filepath> is
used.</li>
<li><codeph>map2tocjs</codeph> calls <codeph>dita.map.tocjs</codeph>,
which generates the contents frame for TocJS output.</li>
<li><codeph>tocjsDefaultOutput</codeph> was added to the process in
version 1.5.4 of the DITA-OT. If scripts are missing some required
information, such as a name for the default frameset, this template
will copy default style and control files. It also ensures that the
XHTML process runs (earlier versions of TocJS created only the JavaScript
control file by default).</li>
</ul></p></section>

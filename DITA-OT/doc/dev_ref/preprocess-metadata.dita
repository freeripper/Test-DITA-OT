<title>Move metadata (move-meta-entries)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>move-meta-entries</codeph> step pushes metadata
back and forth between maps and topics. For example, index entries
and copyrights in the map are pushed into affected topics, so that
topics may be processed later in isolation while retaining all relevant
metadata.</shortdesc>

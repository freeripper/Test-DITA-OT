<h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA to TocJS</h1>


<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The "tocjs" transform type is an XHTML based output type
that also generates a frameset and a JavaScript based table of contents
with expandable and collapsible entries. The tocjs transform type
was originally created by Shawn McKenzie as a plug-in to the toolkit,
and later bundled with the default distribution.</p>

<p class="p">The original tocjs output required an Ant build with several parameters
in order to function properly; it also required a separate transform
to XHTML in order to produce content. Beginning with DITA-OT release
1.5.4, the tocjs transform type was updated to always produce XHTML
output and to use a default frameset when one is not already specified.</p>

<p class="p">In release 1.5.4 the tocjs transform was also added to the <span class="ph filepath">build_demo.xml</span> script
as an option for the output type.</p>

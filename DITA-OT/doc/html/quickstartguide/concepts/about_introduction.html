	 <p class="p">DITA-based writers gain numerous advantages using this powerful,
		single-source, document solution. Indeed, I think of DITA as the Holy Grail of
		technical documentation, the object for which many a manager has sent me on
		long, fruitless searches in the past, only to return with half-hearted
		recommendations for a combination of tools that required hours of manual
		tweaking to reproduce a document in just one alternative format.	 
	 </p>
 
	 <p class="p">Today, I can tell my manager that the Grail has been found, and I can
		produce a handful of different document output types simultaneously. This is a breakthrough technology
		for technical writers. In industry jargon, "single source" has previously meant writing in FrameMaker, then
		importing your source into another expensive application to produce a second output format, typically online help.
		To gain just a second format from the source often required tedious hours, sometimes days, massaging the text
		after it had been "translated" into an online help system. DITA-OT allows technical writers to produce seven output formats
		at the same time.</p>

	<p class="p">However, several technologies make this magic happen.
		Motivated, or just curious, writers will want a more advanced
		understanding of what makes DITA tick.  To do so, you will need to learn how
		to write Ant build scripts for the DITA-OT and invoke them from the command line.

	  <p class="p">Hopefully, this guide will motivate you to study DITA-OT further and encourage your publications team to implement a
		single-source, DITA-based documentation solution.

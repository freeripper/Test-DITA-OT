    Non-Committers</h1>

  
  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">Before committing code from a bug fix or patch provided by a third party 
      who has not signed a current Common Public License to become a 
      Contributor to the project, the IBM committer should ask the following 
      questions and follow up as appropriate in order to ensure that the code 
      can be contributed to the project: </p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">What is your name and who is your employer?</li>

      <li class="li">Did you write the code that you wish to contribute to the DITA Open 
        Toolkit project? (If the contributor says no, do not submit it as a 
        “Contribution” to the project. You may ask the contributor to identify 
        the complete details of the code’s source and of any licenses or 
        restrictions applicable to the code, but you should conspicuously mark 
        the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [name of 
        contributor]” when you submit it to the list.)</li>

      <li class="li">Do you have the right to grant the copyright and patent licenses for 
        the contribution that are set forth in the CPL version 1.0 license and
        Apache License version 2.0?</li>

      <li class="li">Does your employer have any rights to code that you have written, for 
        example, through your contract for employment? If so, has your employer 
        given you permission to contribute the code on its behalf or waived its 
        rights in the code?</li>

      <li class="li">Are you aware of any third-party licenses or other restrictions (such 
        as related patents or trademarks) that could apply to your 
        contribution? If so, what are they?</li>

    </ul>

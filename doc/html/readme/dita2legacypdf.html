<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The first few versions of the toolkit came with a demo
PDF build, which was eventually replaced by the much more robust PDF
Plug-in (also known as PDF2). This code is no longer maintained by
the DITA-OT developers.</p>

<p class="p">The demo PDF transform was deprecated in DITA-OT release 1.4.3,
when it was replaced by the PDF Plug-in. The older script is still
included in order to support older customizations or build scripts
that extended the code; however, the transform type must be set to
"legacypdf".</p>

<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The PDF process (formerly known as PDF2) runs the preprocess
routine, followed by a series of additional targets. These steps work
together to create a merged set of content, convert that to XSL-FO,
and then format the FO file to PDF.</p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">The PDF process adds many new Ant targets. During a typical
conversion from map to PDF, the following targets are most significant.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">map2pdf2</samp> creates a merged file by calling a common
Java merge module. It then calls <samp class="ph codeph">publish.map.pdf</samp> to
do the remainder of the work.</li>

<li class="li">The <samp class="ph codeph">publish.map.pdf</samp> target does some initialization,
and then calls <samp class="ph codeph">transform.topic2pdf</samp> to do the remainder
of processing. That target runs all of the following steps.<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">transform.topic2fo</samp> is used to convert the merged
file to an XSL-FO file. This process is composed of several Ant targets.<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">transform.topic2fo.index</samp> runs a Java process
to set up index processing, based on the document language. This step
generates the file <span class="ph filepath">stage1.xml</span> in the temporary
processing directory.</li>

<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">transform.topic2fo.flagging</samp> sets up preprocessing
for flagging based on a DITAVAL file. This step generates the file <span class="ph filepath">stage1a.xml</span> in
the temporary processing directory.</li>

<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">transform.topic2fo.main</samp> does the bulk of the
conversion from DITA to XSL-FO. It runs the XSLT based process that
creates <span class="ph filepath">stage2.fo</span> in the temporary processing
directory.</li>

<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">transform.topic2fo.i18n</samp> does additional localization
processing on the FO file; it runs a Java process that converts <span class="ph filepath">stage2.fo</span> into <span class="ph filepath">stage3.fo</span>,
followed by an XSLT process that converts <span class="ph filepath">stage3.fo</span> into <span class="ph filepath">topic.fo</span>.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">transform.fo2pdf</samp> converts the <span class="ph filepath">topic.fo</span> file
into PDF using the available FO processor (Antenna House, XEP, or
Apache FOP).</li>

<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">delete.fo2pdf.topic.fo</samp> deletes the <span class="ph filepath">topic.fo</span> file,
unless otherwise specified by setting an Ant property or command line
option.</li>

</ul>
</li>

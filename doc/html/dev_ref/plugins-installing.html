<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Plug-ins are generally distributed as zip files. There are two steps to installing a
    plug-in: unzipping and integrating.</p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">It is possible to define a plug-in so that it may be installed
anywhere, although most expect to be placed in either the <span class="ph filepath">demo/</span> or <span class="ph filepath">plugins/</span> directory
inside of the DITA-OT. Most plug-ins do not require a specific install
directory and can go in either of the default locations, but some
may come with instructions for a particular install directory. The
first step to installing a plug-in is to unzip to the desired location.</p>
<div class="p">The remaining step is to integrate the new plug-in. This can be accomplished in a few ways:<ol class="ol">
          <li class="li">From the toolkit directory, you can run the following command to integrate all
            installed plug-ins:<pre class="pre codeblock">ant -f integrator.xml</pre>
<p class="p">The integration
              process has two modes, lax and strict. In the strict mode the integration process will
              immediately fail if it encounters errors in plug-in configurations or installation
              process. In the lax mode, the integration process will continue to finish regardless
              of errors; the lax mode does not imply error recovery and may leave the DITA-OT
              installation into a broken state. The default mode is lax due to backwards
              compatibility, to run the integration in strict
              mode:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">ant -f integrator.xml strict</pre>
<p class="p">To get
              more information about the integration process, run Ant in verbose
            mode:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">ant -f integrator.xml -verbose strict</pre>
</li>

          <li class="li">Any build that uses the Java command line interface automatically runs the integrator
            before processing begins.</li>

          <li class="li">Ant based builds may import the <samp class="ph codeph">integrator.xml</samp> file, and add
              <samp class="ph codeph">integrate</samp> to the start of the dependency chain for the build.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The integration process in considered part of the installation process and
              running it before each conversion will incur a preformance penalty.</div>
</li>

        </ol>

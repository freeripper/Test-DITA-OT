<h1 class="title topictitle1">Generating XHTML with navigation</h1>


<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The toolkit ships with several varieties of XHTML output,
each of which follows roughly the same path through the processing
pipeline. All XHTML builds begin with the same call to the preprocess
routine, after which they generate XHTML files and then branch to
create navigation files.</p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">Once the preprocess runs, XHTML based builds each run
a common series of Ant targets. Navigation may be created before or
after this set of common routines.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">When the CSS parameter is passed to the build to add a CSS file,
the <samp class="ph codeph">copy-css</samp> target copies that CSS file from its
source location to the proper relative location in the output directory.</li>

<li class="li">When a DITAVAL file is used, the <samp class="ph codeph">copy-revflag</samp> target
copies the default start and end revision flags into the output directory.</li>

<li class="li">Two targets names <samp class="ph codeph">dita.inner.topics.xhtml</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">dita.outer.topics.xhtml</samp> are
used to convert DITA topics into XHTML documents. At this point after
the preprocess has completed, each DITA topic document in the temporary
directory corresponds to one XHTML output document. The "inner" template
is used to process documents that are in the map directory (or subdirectories
of that directory). The "outer" template is used to process documents
that are outside of the scope of the map, and may end up outside of
the designated output directory. Parameters to the build control how
documents processed by the "outer" target are handled.</li>

</ul>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../dev_ref/XhtmlDefault.html">Default XHTML output</a></strong><br/>
The <samp class="ph codeph">dita.map.xhtml</samp> target is called by default xhtml builds. This target generates a TOC file called index.html, which may be loaded into an independent frameset.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../dev_ref/XhtmlEclipse.html">Eclipse help output (transform type "eclipsehelp")</a></strong><br/>
Eclipse help is an XHTML based output format intended to create a plug-in for the Eclipse Help system. Once the normal XHTML process has run, the <samp class="ph codeph">dita.map.eclipse</samp> target is used to create a set of several control files and navigation files for Eclipse.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../dev_ref/XhtmlTocjs.html">TocJS output path</a></strong><br/>
The TocJS transform type was originally created as a plug-in distributed outside of the toolkit, but now ships bundled in the default packages. This XHTML based output type creates a JavaScript based frameset with TOC entries that expand and collapse.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../dev_ref/XhtmlCHM.html">Compiled Help (CHM) output</a></strong><br/>
The transform type "htmlhelp" is used to create HTML Help control files. If the build runs on a system that has the HTML Help compiler installed, the control files will be compiled into a CHM file.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../dev_ref/XhtmlJavahelp.html">Javahelp output</a></strong><br/>
The "javahelp" transform type runs several additional Ant targets after the XHTML process is completed in order to create control files for JavaHelp output.</li>

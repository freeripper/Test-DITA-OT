<title>Compiled Help (CHM) output</title>
<shortdesc>The transform type "htmlhelp" is used to create HTML Help
control files. If the build runs on a system that has the HTML Help
compiler installed, the control files will be compiled into a CHM
file.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>Once the preprocess and XHTML process is complete, most
of the HTML Help processing is handled by the <codeph>dita.map.htmlhelp</codeph> target.
This target creates several files:<ul>
<li>The HHP file is the control file for the HTML Help project.</li>
<li>The HHC file contains the HTML Help table of contents.</li>
<li>The HHK file contains the HTML Help index. This file is sorted
based on the language of the map.</li>
</ul></p><p>The <codeph>dita.htmlhelp.convertlang</codeph> is a post-processor
for the content to ensure that it can be processed correctly by the
compiler, and that the appropriate codepages and languages are used.</p><p>Finally, <codeph>compile.HTML.Help</codeph> attempts
to detect the HTML Help compiler; if found, it compiles the full project
into a single CHM file.</p></section>

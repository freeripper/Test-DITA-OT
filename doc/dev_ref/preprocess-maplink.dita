<title>Map based linking (maplink and move-links)</title>
<shortdesc>These two steps work together to create links based on
a map and move those links into referenced topics. The links are created
based on hierarchy (parent/child), the collection-type attribute (sequential
or family links), and relationship tables.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>maplink</codeph> module first runs an XSLT
program that evaluates the map, and places all generated links into
a single file in the temporary processing directory. Once that file
is created, the <codeph>move-links</codeph> module runs a Java program
that pushes the generated links into the proper topics.</p></section>
